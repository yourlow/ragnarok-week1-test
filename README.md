Hi all,

I wouldn't recommend just pulling this repo and opening with your favourite IDE instead,

1.)

go create a libgdx project i followed the intellij tutorial from this

https://gamefromscratch.com/libgdx-video-tutorial-series/
(make sure you add desktop into the project)

2.)

these are the only 2 files ive made changes too, so copy the source files from core
and from desktop into you

ragnarok-week1-test/core/src/com/mygdx/game/MyGdxGame.java

ragnarok-week1-test/desktop/src/com/mygdx/game/desktop
